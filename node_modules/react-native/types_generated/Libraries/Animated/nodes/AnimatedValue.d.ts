 * A) Top Down phase
 * When an Animated.Value is updated, we recursively go down through this
 * graph in order to find leaf nodes: the views that we flag as needing
 * an update.
 *
 * B) Bottom Up phase
 * When a view is flagged as needing an update, we recursively go back up
 * in order to build the new value that it needs. The reason why we need
 * this two-phases process is to deal with composite props such as
 * transform which can receive values from multiple parents.
