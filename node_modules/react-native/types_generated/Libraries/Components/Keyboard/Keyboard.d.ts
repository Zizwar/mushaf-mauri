 * `Keyboard` module to control keyboard events.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The Keyboard module allows you to listen for native events and react to them, as
 * well as make changes to the keyboard, like dismissing it.
 *
 *```
 * import React, { Component } from 'react';
 * import { Keyboard, TextInput } from 'react-native';
 *
 * class Example extends Component {
 *   componentWillMount () {
 *     this.keyboardDidShowListener = Keyboard.addListener('keyboardDidShow', this._keyboardDidShow);
 *     this.keyboardDidHideListener = Keyboard.addListener('keyboardDidHide', this._keyboardDidHide);
 *   }
 *
 *   componentWillUnmount () {
 *     this.keyboardDidShowListener.remove();
 *     this.keyboardDidHideListener.remove();
 *   }
 *
 *   _keyboardDidShow () {
 *     alert('Keyboard Shown');
 *   }
 *
 *   _keyboardDidHide () {
 *     alert('Keyboard Hidden');
 *   }
 *
 *   render() {
 *     return (
 *       <TextInput
 *         onSubmitEditing={Keyboard.dismiss}
 *       />
 *     );
 *   }
 * }
 *```
